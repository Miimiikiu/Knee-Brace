## TODO:
-Originally made for Raspberry Pi 3B+ -- Migrate to ESP32 for better performance & reliability and faster startup.

-Currently only works with one pressure sensor but at least two + stretch sensor band should be required.

-Shin brace should be adjustable but snug

-Redesign & upload STL files
