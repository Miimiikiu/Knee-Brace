# Knee-Brace
 Software for prototype robotic knee brace to assist walking for users with ALS, MS, MD, etc.

## Usage

Requires 3D printed STL files, Raspberry Pi 3B+ with Ubuntu Server, Battery, Servomotor

## TODO:
-Originally made for Raspberry Pi 3B+ -- Migrate to ESP32 for better performance & reliability and faster startup.

-Currently only works with one pressure sensor but at least two + stretch sensor band should be required.

-Shin brace should be adjustable but snug

-Redesign & upload STL files
